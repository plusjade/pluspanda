      This text will display at the top of your public form.
      Place your company name here, offer incentives for submitting testimonials,
      or just give a nice thank you.
  .form-group
    %label Customer Full Name
    %p.indent
      A customer's full name is always required. You can optionally require 3 more fields:
  .form-group
    %label Access Key
    %input.form-control{name: "tconfig[form][require_key]", type: "text", value: @user.tconfig.form['require_key'] }
    .indent
      New testimonials cannot be created without
      %em this
      valid access key.
  .form-group
    %label Require Email (Yes)
    %input.form-control{name: "tconfig[form][email]", type: "checkbox", checked: !!@user.tconfig.form['email'] }
    .indent
      Customers are required to enter a valid email address.
      Use this option if you wish to openly collect testimonials from anyone interested in writing one.
      This way you can maintain contact with people you may not know.
  .form-group
    %label Define Meta Data Name
    %input.form-control{name: "tconfig[form][meta]", type: "text", value: @user.tconfig.form['meta'] }
    .indent
      Customers are required to enter specific meta data defined below.
      %br/
      %b Example:
      If you wish to collect testimonials from only customers that have
      made purchases, you can place the link onto your order confirmation page. Rather than using
      an email identifier of which you already have, you can pass the order confirmation code or customer_id as meta data.
