<h3>Overview</h3>
 <div class="indent">
   The "Build Widget" section is used to configure and edit all parts of how your widget will display.
   We will go through the tabs one by one and explain the functionality.
   <br/>
   The top portion controls some basic settings for your widget.
   # of testimonials sets how many testimonials display at a time per page.
   You can also order the testimonials by date or custom positions.

 <h3>Installed Themes</h3>
 <div class="indent">
   The installed themes list shows all the themes you currently have installed on your account.
   To install more themes go to the top right "Theme Gallery".
   The orange highlighted theme is the theme that is currently "staged".

   <h5>Staging</h5>
   The staged theme is the theme you are editing and the theme that shows up in the "staged view".
   Any edits you make to the HTML or CSS will show immediately in the staged view.
   However it will NOT affect the published view at all.
   Pluspanda does not keep track of which theme is published only which theme is staged.

   <h5>Publishing</h5>
   To publish any changes to your widget you simply go to the staged view, verify your changes, and click "publish changes".
   Note that publishing changes will always mean "publish my staging edits".
   In other words you always work in the staging environment and never directly touch the published view.

 <h3>Published View Tab</h3>
 <div class="indent">
   <p>
     This tab shows a published view of your widget, the way it will look when you install it on your website.
   </p>
   <p>
     To update your published view you must work with your staged view first, verify your changes, and then click
     "publish changes" located in the "Staged View" tab.
   </p>
   <p>
     Remember only testimonials marked <b>published</b> will display in the widget.
   </p>

 <h3>Staged View Tab</h3>  
 <div class="indent">
   This tab shows a staged view of your widget. It automatically changes any and every time
   you make edits to the HTML or CSS. This allows you to preview and verify your customizations before
   you publish them.
 </div>

 <h3>Edit Wrapper HTML Tab</h3>  
 <div class="indent">
   The wrapper HTML is the over all HTML template that makes up your widget.
   Each testimonial gets displayed <em>inside</em> of your wrapper HTML.
   To the right of the editor there are a list of tokens.
   Using tokens allows you to place pluspanda data wherever you wish.
   <br/>The {{testimonials}} token is used to place the list of testimonials in your HTML
   <br/>The {{count}} token will output a count of your current total number of testimonials.
   <br/>The {{form_link:Add Testimonial}} token is new in pluspanda. It creates a link on your widget
   that will load your collection form right on your own website.

   The testimonial HTML is the HTML used to display <em>each</em> testimonial.
